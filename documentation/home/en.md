# Welcome
Welcome to [rejuvena/tml-wiki](https://github.com/rejuvena/tml-wiki), a source of information for tModLoader mod development and other Terraria modding/tModLoader-related things..

To get started, consider checking out the [glossary](glossary) hub, which will redirect you to numerous articles.

## Purpose
This serves as a personal collection of tutorials and other useful tidbits of information I would like to share with everyone. I am not a fan of the [tModLoader GitHub wiki](https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/wiki) because of its outdated and contrasting nature, but I cannot be asked to fix it up either. This wiki also has information that doesn't fit on the official wiki.

## Licensing
All textual information located on this wiki is licensed under the _Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal_ license, which can be found [here](https://github.com/uranometrical/notes/blob/master/LICENSE). In short, everything is released into the public domainâ€”hands-free.

## Contributing
This is not currently a written style guide, but articles should be written in American English and with a formal, informative tone that does not include emotional or personal speech. By contributing, you agree to out license (see above).

Open pull requests [here](https://github.com/rejuvena/tml-wiki), if you'd like to contribute.
